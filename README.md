### CycleJS basic flow

![](dots/cycle.dot.svg)

But `app` will likely have inner components too.

### CycleJS Components

![](dots/component.dot.svg)

- `sources` is an object with streams (and sometimes other things)
- `sinks` is an object with streams

### The MVI pattern

Internally a component will commonly use the [Model View Intent pattern](https://cycle.js.org/model-view-intent.html)

### Fractal state approach

[Cycle State API](https://cycle.js.org/api/state.html)

Outermost component has entire state (like redux store)

### Lenses

Adapted for child component via lenses
